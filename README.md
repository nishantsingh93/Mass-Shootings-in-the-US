Redesign Project- US Mass Shootings: Last 50 Years (1966-2017)



Project statement:

•	Motivation - My motivation for doing this redesign Project was due to the tragic event that happened in Las Vegas and the lives of people permanently altered by it. We as lawful residents of this Great Country have a responsibility of protesting against things which is causing harm to the people. 

•	Objective - The objective of this redesign project is to take an existing visualization, and redo the same to discover new effective metrics to better portray the message 

•	Data - The data that I have analyzed came from Kaggle, and I used an existing visualization done on this data by Cleuton Sampaio to first understand his findings, present my thoughts about it, criticize it, and do a better Visualization using the same data and same metrics that the author of the original Visualization used.

•	Project Plan: The project plan that I have followed deciding on the project, was first looking for the visualization done by authors on the topic. After selecting a visualization that I want redesign, I first understood what the author was trying to do. Then I started data wrangling with the data that I had, where I added some missing data, deleted some rows where data was missing and finally doing some basic visualization in python notebook. Then I started the visualization in Tableau thinking of how can I better do the existing Visualization, thinking of useful metrics and presenting as much information I could in the simplest way possible and getting across the massage on the need for Gun control as soon as possible. I went through intermediate version where I started with very simple Tableau visualization and then I arrived at my final version after many iterations.

Making-of the Redesign Project:

•	Development Process: Understanding the data, and then analyzing the visualization done by the author. The following were the Pros and Cons of the Visualization that the original
Visualization had.

Pros:

ϖ	The author tried to do a scatter plot of representing incidents on the map of the US in python which can be very difficult to do.
ϖ	He has tried to represent that there were more victims on the west coast rather than the east coast in the incidents that has happened. 
ϖ	Looking at his scatter plot we can also see that the frequency of shootings is more on the east coast than the west coast.

Cons:
ϖ	One of the major drawbacks I could see is that it is very hard to gain which places these incidents have occurred 
ϖ	It does not indicate either the summary or the title of the incident that took place when we click on the dots
ϖ	We also need a total count of incidents happening in different states to gauze the effect of gun laws in different states  
ϖ	Also, a total count of victims will give an insight into possible weapons used such as more no of victims indicate a possible use of automatic weapons

•	Data Wrangling: The data wrangling is done in Juypter and the I have done a detail explanation in Juypter

•	Intermediate visualization:  Explained in Juypter notebook 

•	Redesign Visualization:  In my final visualization, I have tried to include three Graphs to explain my findings from the data set. My reason for select a black background was since the graph in the light background was not as reflective as it should have been. The background was very dull and to show my findings I had to highlight it by making the background dark. The following process I went through to do a redesign of the authors dataset 
 
¬	Approach: There were some basic data wrangling done where I added some missing data such as Latitude and Longitude for import incidents, followed by rearranging data, deleting irrelevant data. These steps have been explained in my juypter notebook. I choose my metrics to be a comparison between 9 most and least restrictive Gun law states based on total victims by population of that State.

¬	Claim: Gun Laws in States not the real cause of Mass Shootings!!

¬	Data: The data I have clearly acts as my evidence showcasing that the different Gun Laws in various state are not the real cause of these Mass Shootings.

¬	Warrant: The data I worked with showcases that the number of victims of these mass shootings are on a rise every year. However, the Visualization of total victims to population of the 9 most restrictive and 9 most lenient states show a random pattern where there is no correlation between the ratio generated between the states. This is indirectly conveying that tough the people blame the NRA and lenient Gun laws in the States, the reason for the Mass shooting are much more complex that what it looks like.

¬	Backing: For example, California has the most restrictive gun laws, still it has 392 people dead, whereas Texas and Nevada which have average restriction in gun laws have witnessed 612 and 270 deaths so far in the last 50 years. If we look at the least restrictive states such as Missouri which has seen 4 such incidents of shootings and had 23 victims. At first the visualization may look like the states with more restrictive gun laws had more deaths which means the restrictiveness is somewhat related to it but after analyzing the ratios, it is now clear that more death must do with the weapons used in various incidents in a state. For example, in few of the Incident in Nevada and California   automatic weapons were used. In the first Visualization, we can also see the frequency of attacks are more in the East coast then the west coast but more people have died in the West Coast as the scale of these attacks were very large.


•	Future Scope: In the future following things can be done with the data set:

ϖ	Compare a State in 10 year periods to bolster the argument that the restrictiveness of Gun Law has an impact over the Mass Shootings.
ϖ	Add data such as type of weapons used to see which weapons should be placed in restrictive categories.
ϖ	Explore which periods of the year on average experienced more shootings over the others.
ϖ	Add additional data about the shooter and explore his reasons that made him do what he did.
